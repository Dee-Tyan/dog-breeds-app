## Application Description

This is a dog finder application implemented with VUE.JS. Site visitors see a list of 100 dog images by default when they load the application, and each image routes to a web page with more information about the dog. Site visitors can also search for dogs by their breeds.

The application implements caching of the images to reduce the number of API calls to Dog.CEO. It is also fully responsive.
